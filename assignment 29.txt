File Handling

1. Write a Python script to print the following status of a file:
a. Whether a file is read only.
b. Whether a file is closed or not
c. Which file opening mode is used
d. Name of the file
f=open("demo.txt",'r')
f.read()
f.close()


2. Write a Python script to create a new file ‘myfile.txt’ and store user entered text.
def  writing(filename,text):
    f=open(filename,'w')
    f.write(text)
    f.close()
writing("myfile.txt","welcome")
output:
welcome
3. Write a Python script to read the above created file ‘myfile.txt’ and display content on
the console.
def  read(filename):
    f=open(filename,'r')
    
    f.close()
read("myfile.txt")
output:
welcome
4. Write a Python script to store a list of city names in a file ‘cities.txt’
city=["pune","mumbai","dheli","bell"]
with open("cities.txt","w") as f:
    for item in city:
        f.write("%s\n" %item)
        print("done")
output:
pune
mumbai
dheli
bell

5. Write a Python script to append list of city names in a file ‘cities.txt’
city=["kalayn","varsoli"]
with open("cities.txt","a") as f:
    for item in city:
        f.write("%s\n" %item)
        print("done")
output:
pune
mumbai
dheli
bell
kalayn
varsoli

6. Write a Python script to search whether a particular city is there in the file ‘cities.txt’ or
not
def search(filename,city):
    try:
        f=open(filename,'r')
        line_count=0
        for line in f.readlines():
            line_count+=1
            strlist=line.split(" ")
            word_count=0
            for w in strlist:
                word_count+=1
            if city==w:
                print(line_count,"found")
            else:
                print(None)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("file dose not found")
search("cities.txt","mumbai")
            
output:
2,found
7. Write a Python script to count the number of Python keywords occurring in a python
source file.
def key(filename,keyword):
    f=open(filename,"r")
    for line in f.readlines():
        l=line.split(" ")
        key_count=0
        for s in l:
            if s==keyword:
                key_count+=1
                print(keyword,key_count)
                
    else:
        print(None)
key("project.py","if")

output:
if 6
8. Write a Python script to create a copy of a file.
import shutil
shutil.copyfile("cities.txt","demo.txt")
output:
pune
mumbai
dheli
bell
kalayn
varsoli

9. Write a Python script to store book data in a file. Book data is in the form of a
dictionary in which book name is the key and price is its value. Use pickle to store
data into a file (say bookfile)
import pickle
book={'bname':'fire','bprize':200}
f=open('bookinfo','ab')
pickle.dump(book,f)
f.close()

10. Write a Python script to extract book data from a bookfile using pickle. Also print
import pickle
f=open('bookinfo','rb')
s=pickle.load(f)
for key in s:
    print(key," :",s[key])
f.close()
output:
bname  : fire
bprize  : 200
